demonstrates the basics of using the Microsoft Foundation classes but
is also a starting point for writing your DLL.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your XTToolkit_Dll DLL.

XTToolkit_Dll.cpp
    This is the main DLL source file that contains the definition of
	DllMain().


XTToolkit_Dll.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored
    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft
	Developer Studio.

res\XTToolkit_Dll.rc2

	Developer Studio.  You should place all resources not
	editable by the resource editor in this file.

XTToolkit_Dll.def
    This file contains information about the DLL that must be
    provided to run with Microsoft Windows.  It defines parameters
    such as the name and description of the DLL.  It also exports
	functions from the DLL.

XTToolkit_Dll.clw

    classes or add new classes.  ClassWizard also uses this file to store
    information needed to create and edit message maps and dialog data
    maps and to create prototype member functions.
